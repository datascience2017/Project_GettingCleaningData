Data Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The data in the folder Inertial Signals was not used for this project.

Measurements:

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Data Transformation:
The following transformations were performed on the data:
Data Cleaning was performed in the following steps and accomplished by R script run_analysis.R
The test and the training data sets have been merged to form a single data set using rbind and cbind functions.
The data was refined using grepl to keep only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Remaining columns were removed.
Descriptive activity names and labels were used appropriately to increase code readability.Activity IDs were replaced with factor variable labeled with Activity names. 
Created a new dataset using sapply function to calculate means of each variable for each activity and each subject. This was the final dataset 'tidydata' and is created in .csv and .txt formats. 
Comments have been posted throughout the R script to increase readability and provide understanding to the reader.
